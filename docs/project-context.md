# Project Context - AutoCRM

## Current Implementation Status

### Core Features
- Ticket CRUD operations with API routes
- Permissions system for ticket actions
- Authentication middleware
- Ticket details view with edit/delete functionality
- Real-time updates for tickets

### Recent Changes
- Updated `TicketDetails` component with permission checks
- Implemented role-based access control
- Fixed authentication redirects in middleware
- Added error handling for API routes

### Current Issues

#### Linter Errors in `TicketDetails.tsx`
- Type mismatch between Supabase User and application User types
- Missing `supabase` property in `useAuth` hook
- Type compatibility issues in permission checks

### Next Steps
1. **Type Resolution**
   - Resolve type mismatches between Supabase and application user types
   - Update `useAuth` hook to include Supabase client
   - Fix permission check type compatibility

2. **Error Handling**
   - Ensure proper error handling across components
   - Implement consistent error messaging
   - Add error boundaries where needed

## Technical Debt
- User type inconsistencies need to be addressed
- Permission system may need refactoring for better scalability
- Authentication flow could be optimized

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing batch operations for tickets
- Evaluate need for more granular permissions
- Plan for scaling real-time updates
