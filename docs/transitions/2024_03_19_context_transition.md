# Context Transition - March 19, 2024

## Context Summary
Working on setting up the AutoCRM project with modern web technologies including NextJS, TypeScript, and Supabase. Implementing core architecture and development guidelines.

## Key Problems
1. Setting up proper architecture patterns and guidelines
2. Implementing proper dependency injection and loose coupling
3. Establishing module boundaries and preventing circular dependencies
4. Managing interface segregation and preventing god objects
5. Setting up proper testing infrastructure

## Solution Progress
### Attempted Solutions
- Created comprehensive development guidelines
- Set up TypeScript configuration with strict mode
- Implemented ESLint rules for code quality
- Configured Jest for testing

### Current Status
- Basic project structure is in place
- Development guidelines are documented
- Core dependencies are installed
- Testing framework is configured

### Blocking Issues
- Need to implement actual components following the guidelines
- Need to set up proper CI/CD pipeline
- Need to implement actual test cases

## Learning Points
- Importance of proper interface segregation
- Benefits of dependency injection for testing
- Value of typed events over string-based events
- Significance of barrel exports for clean imports

## Next Steps
1. Start implementing core components following the guidelines
2. Set up proper testing infrastructure
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Set up proper logging
5. Implement proper monitoring
