## TypeScript support

`supabase-js` has TypeScript support for type inference, autocompletion, type-safe queries, and more.

With TypeScript, `supabase-js` detects things like `not null` constraints and [generated columns](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-generated-columns.html). Nullable columns are typed as `T | null` when you select the column. Generated columns will show a type error when you insert to it.

`supabase-js` also detects relationships between tables. A referenced table with one-to-many relationship is typed as `T[]`. Likewise, a referenced table with many-to-one relationship is typed as `T | null`.

## Generating TypeScript Types[#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/typescript-support#generating-typescript-types)

You can use the Supabase CLI to [generate the types](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/supabase-gen-types). You can also generate the types [from the dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/api?page=tables-intro).

Terminal

`   1  supabase gen types typescript --project-id abcdefghijklmnopqrst > database.types.ts            `

These types are generated from your database schema. Given a table `public.movies`, the generated types will look like:

`   1  create table public.movies (    2  id bigint generated always as identity primary key,    3  name text not null,    4  data jsonb null    5  );            `

./database.types.ts

``   1  export type Json = string | number | boolean | null | { [key: string]: Json | undefined } | Json[]    2      3  export interface Database {    4  public: {    5  Tables: {    6  movies: {    7  Row: { // the data expected from .select()    8  id: number    9  name: string    10  data: Json | null    11  }    12  Insert: { // the data to be passed to .insert()    13  id?: never // generated columns must not be supplied    14  name: string // `not null` columns with no default must be supplied    15  data?: Json | null // nullable columns can be omitted    16  }    17  Update: { // the data to be passed to .update()    18  id?: never    19  name?: string // `not null` columns are optional on .update()    20  data?: Json | null    21  }    22  }    23  }    24  }    25  }            ``

## Using TypeScript type definitions[#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/typescript-support#using-typescript-type-definitions)

You can supply the type definitions to `supabase-js` like so:

./index.tsx

`   1  import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'    2  import { Database } from './database.types'    3      4  const supabase = createClient<Database>(    5  process.env.SUPABASE_URL,    6  process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY    7  )            `

## Helper types for Tables and Joins[#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/typescript-support#helper-types-for-tables-and-joins)

You can use the following helper types to make the generated TypeScript types easier to use.

Sometimes the generated types are not what you expect. For example, a view's column may show up as nullable when you expect it to be `not null`. Using [type-fest](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest), you can override the types like so:

./database-generated.types.ts

`   1  export type Json = // ...    2      3  export interface Database {    4  // ...    5  }            `

./database.types.ts

``   1  import { MergeDeep } from 'type-fest'    2  import { Database as DatabaseGenerated } from './database-generated.types'    3  export { Json } from './database-generated.types'    4      5  // Override the type for a specific column in a view:    6  export type Database = MergeDeep<    7  DatabaseGenerated,    8  {    9  public: {    10  Views: {    11  movies_view: {    12  Row: {    13  // id is a primary key in public.movies, so it must be `not null`    14  id: number    15  }    16  }    17  }    18  }    19  }    20  >            ``

You can also override the type of an individual successful response if needed:

`   1  const { data } = await supabase.from('countries').select().returns<MyType>()            `

The generated types provide shorthands for accessing tables and enums.

./index.ts

`   1  import { Database, Tables, Enums } from "./database.types.ts";    2      3  // Before üòï    4  let movie: Database['public']['Tables']['movies']['Row'] = // ...    5      6  // After üòç    7  let movie: Tables<'movies'>            `

### Response types for complex queries[#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/typescript-support#response-types-for-complex-queries)

`supabase-js` always returns a `data` object (for success), and an `error` object (for unsuccessful requests).

These helper types provide the result types from any query, including nested types for database joins.

Given the following schema with a relation between cities and countries, we can get the nested `CountriesWithCities` type:

`   1  create table countries (    2  "id" serial primary key,    3  "name" text    4  );    5      6  create table cities (    7  "id" serial primary key,    8  "name" text,    9  "country_id" int references "countries"    10  );            `

``   1  import { QueryResult, QueryData, QueryError } from '@supabase/supabase-js'    2      3  const countriesWithCitiesQuery = supabase    4  .from("countries")    5  .select(`    6  id,    7  name,    8  cities (    9  id,    10  name    11  )    12  `);    13  type CountriesWithCities = QueryData<typeof countriesWithCitiesQuery>;    14      15  const { data, error } = await countriesWithCitiesQuery;    16  if (error) throw error;    17  const countriesWithCities: CountriesWithCities = data;            ``

---

## Fetch data

Perform a SELECT query on the table or view.

- By default, Supabase projects return a maximum of 1,000 rows. This setting can be changed in your project's¬†[API settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api). It's recommended that you keep it low to limit the payload size of accidental or malicious requests. You can use¬†`range()`¬†queries to paginate through your data.
- `select()`¬†can be combined with¬†[Filters](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/using-filters)
- `select()`¬†can be combined with¬†[Modifiers](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/using-modifiers)
- `apikey`¬†is a reserved keyword if you're using the¬†[Supabase Platform](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform)¬†and¬†[should be avoided as a column name](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/5465).

### Parameters

- columnsOptionalQuery
    
    The columns to retrieve, separated by commas. Columns can be renamed when returned with `customName:columnName`
    
- optionsRequiredobject

## Update data

Perform an UPDATE on the table or view.

- `update()`¬†should always be combined with¬†[Filters](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/using-filters)¬†to target the item(s) you wish to update.

### Parameters

- valuesRequiredRow
    
    The values to update with
    
- optionsRequiredobject

## Upsert data

Perform an UPSERT on the table or view. Depending on the column(s) passed to `onConflict`, `.upsert()` allows you to perform the equivalent of `.insert()` if a row with the corresponding `onConflict` columns doesn't exist, or if it does exist, perform an alternative action depending on `ignoreDuplicates`.

- Primary keys must be included in¬†`values`¬†to use upsert.

### Parameters

- valuesRequiredUnion: expand to see options
    
    The values to upsert with. Pass an object to upsert a single row or an array to upsert multiple rows.
    
    Details
    
- optionsOptionalobject
    
    Named parameters

Data source

Response

## Delete data

Perform a DELETE on the table or view.

- `delete()`¬†should always be combined with¬†[filters](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/using-filters)¬†to target the item(s) you wish to delete.
- If you use¬†`delete()`¬†with filters and you have¬†[RLS](https://supabase.com/docs/learn/auth-deep-dive/auth-row-level-security)¬†enabled, only rows visible through¬†`SELECT`¬†policies are deleted. Note that by default no rows are visible, so you need at least one¬†`SELECT`/`ALL`¬†policy that makes the rows visible.
- When using¬†`delete().in()`, specify an array of values to target multiple rows with a single query. This is particularly useful for batch deleting entries that share common criteria, such as deleting users by their IDs. Ensure that the array you provide accurately represents all records you intend to delete to avoid unintended data removal.

### Parameters

- optionsRequiredobject
    
    Named parameters

## Call a Postgres function

Perform a function call.

You can call Postgres functions as _Remote Procedure Calls_, logic in your database that you can execute from anywhere. Functions are useful when the logic rarely changes‚Äîlike for password resets and updates.

`   1  create or replace function hello_world() returns text as $$    2  select 'Hello world';    3  $$ language sql;            `

To call Postgres functions on [Read Replicas](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/read-replicas), use the `get: true` option.

### Parameters

- fnRequiredFnName
    
    The function name to call
    
- argsRequiredFn['Args']
    
    The arguments to pass to the function call
    
- optionsRequiredobject
    
    Named parameters

## Using filters

Filters allow you to only return rows that match certain conditions.

Filters can be used on `select()`, `update()`, `upsert()`, and `delete()` queries.

If a Postgres function returns a table response, you can also apply filters.

Applying FiltersChainingConditional ChainingFilter by values within a JSON columnFilter referenced tables

`   1  const { data, error } = await supabase    2  .from('cities')    3  .select('name, country_id')    4  .eq('name', 'The Shire') // Correct    5      6  const { data, error } = await supabase    7  .from('cities')    8  .eq('name', 'The Shire') // Incorrect    9  .select('name, country_id')            `

## Using modifiers

Filters work on the row level‚Äîthey allow you to return rows that only match certain conditions without changing the shape of the rows. Modifiers are everything that don't fit that definition‚Äîallowing you to change the format of the response (e.g., returning a CSV string).

Modifiers must be specified after filters. Some modifiers only apply for queries that return rows (e.g., `select()` or `rpc()` on a function that returns a table response).

Response

---

## Limit the query to a range

Limit the query result by starting at an offset (`from`) and ending at the offset (`from + to`). Only records within this range are returned. This respects the query order and if there is no order clause the range could behave unexpectedly. The `from` and `to` values are 0-based and inclusive: `range(1, 3)` will include the second, third and fourth rows of the query.

## Using explain

Return `data` as the EXPLAIN plan for the query.

For debugging slow queries, you can get the [Postgres `EXPLAIN` execution plan](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-explain.html) of a query using the `explain()` method. This works on any query, even for `rpc()` or writes.

Explain is not enabled by default as it can reveal sensitive information about your database. It's best to only enable this for testing environments but if you wish to enable it for production you can provide additional protection by using a `pre-request` function.

Follow the [Performance Debugging Guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/debugging-performance) to enable the functionality on your project.

## Overview

- The auth methods can be accessed via the `supabase.auth` namespace.
    
- By default, the supabase client sets `persistSession` to true and attempts to store the session in local storage. When using the supabase client in an environment that doesn't support local storage, you might notice the following warning message being logged:
    
    > No storage option exists to persist the session, which may result in unexpected behavior when using auth. If you want to set `persistSession` to true, please provide a storage option or you may set `persistSession` to false to disable this warning.
    
    This warning message can be safely ignored if you're not using auth on the server-side. If you are using auth and you want to set `persistSession` to true, you will need to provide a custom storage implementation that follows [this interface](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js/blob/master/src/lib/types.ts#L1027).
    
- Any email links and one-time passwords (OTPs) sent have a default expiry of 24 hours. We have the following [rate limits](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/going-into-prod#auth-rate-limits) in place to guard against brute force attacks.
    
- The expiry of an access token can be set in the "JWT expiry limit" field in [your project's auth settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/auth). A refresh token never expires and can only be used once.
    

Create auth clientCreate auth client (server-side)

`   1  import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'    2      3  const supabase = createClient(supabase_url, anon_key)            `

---

## Create a new user

Creates a new user.

- By default, the user needs to verify their email address before logging in. To turn this off, disable¬†**Confirm email**¬†in¬†[your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers).
- **Confirm email**¬†determines if users need to confirm their email address after signing up.
    - If¬†**Confirm email**¬†is enabled, a¬†`user`¬†is returned but¬†`session`¬†is null.
    - If¬†**Confirm email**¬†is disabled, both a¬†`user`¬†and a¬†`session`¬†are returned.
- When the user confirms their email address, they are redirected to the¬†[`SITE_URL`](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/redirect-urls)¬†by default. You can modify your¬†`SITE_URL`¬†or add additional redirect URLs in¬†[your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration).
- If signUp() is called for an existing confirmed user:
    - When both¬†**Confirm email**¬†and¬†**Confirm phone**¬†(even when phone provider is disabled) are enabled in¬†[your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers), an obfuscated/fake user object is returned.
    - When either¬†**Confirm email**¬†or¬†**Confirm phone**¬†(even when phone provider is disabled) is disabled, the error message,¬†`User already registered`¬†is returned.
- To fetch the currently logged-in user, refer to¬†[`getUser()`](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-getuser).

## Listen to auth events

Receive a notification every time an auth event happens.

- Subscribes to important events occurring on the user's session.
- Use on the frontend/client. It is less useful on the server.
- Events are emitted across tabs to keep your application's UI up-to-date. Some events can fire very frequently, based on the number of tabs open. Use a quick and efficient callback function, and defer or debounce as many operations as you can to be performed outside of the callback.
- **Important:**¬†A callback can be an¬†`async`¬†function and it runs synchronously during the processing of the changes causing the event. You can easily create a dead-lock by using¬†`await`¬†on a call to another method of the Supabase library.
    - Avoid using¬†`async`¬†functions as callbacks.
    - Limit the number of¬†`await`¬†calls in¬†`async`¬†callbacks.
    - Do not use other Supabase functions in the callback function. If you must, dispatch the functions once the callback has finished executing. Use this as a quick way to achieve this:
        
        `   1  supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((event, session) => {    2  setTimeout(async () => {    3  // await on other Supabase function here    4  // this runs right after the callback has finished    5  }, 0)    6  })            `
        
- Emitted events:
    - `INITIAL_SESSION`
        - Emitted right after the Supabase client is constructed and the initial session from storage is loaded.
    - `SIGNED_IN`
        - Emitted each time a user session is confirmed or re-established, including on user sign in and when refocusing a tab.
        - Avoid making assumptions as to when this event is fired, this may occur even when the user is already signed in. Instead, check the user object attached to the event to see if a new user has signed in and update your application's UI.
        - This event can fire very frequently depending on the number of tabs open in your application.
    - `SIGNED_OUT`
        - Emitted when the user signs out. This can be after:
            - A call to¬†`supabase.auth.signOut()`.
            - After the user's session has expired for any reason:
                - User has signed out on another device.
                - The session has reached its timebox limit or inactivity timeout.
                - User has signed in on another device with single session per user enabled.
                - Check the¬†[User Sessions](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/sessions)¬†docs for more information.
        - Use this to clean up any local storage your application has associated with the user.
    - `TOKEN_REFRESHED`
        - Emitted each time a new access and refresh token are fetched for the signed in user.
        - It's best practice and highly recommended to extract the access token (JWT) and store it in memory for further use in your application.
            - Avoid frequent calls to¬†`supabase.auth.getSession()`¬†for the same purpose.
        - There is a background process that keeps track of when the session should be refreshed so you will always receive valid tokens by listening to this event.
        - The frequency of this event is related to the JWT expiry limit configured on your project.
    - `USER_UPDATED`
        - Emitted each time the¬†`supabase.auth.updateUser()`¬†method finishes successfully. Listen to it to update your application's UI based on new profile information.
    - `PASSWORD_RECOVERY`
        - Emitted instead of the¬†`SIGNED_IN`¬†event when the user lands on a page that includes a password recovery link in the URL.
        - Use it to show a UI to the user where they can¬†[reset their password](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/passwords#resetting-a-users-password-forgot-password).

## Sign in a user through OTP

Log in a user using magiclink or a one-time password (OTP).

- Requires either an email or phone number.
- This method is used for passwordless sign-ins where a OTP is sent to the user's email or phone number.
- If the user doesn't exist,¬†`signInWithOtp()`¬†will signup the user instead. To restrict this behavior, you can set¬†`shouldCreateUser`¬†in¬†`SignInWithPasswordlessCredentials.options`¬†to¬†`false`.
- If you're using an email, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a magiclink or a OTP.
- If you're using phone, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a OTP.
- The magic link's destination URL is determined by the¬†[`SITE_URL`](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/redirect-urls).
- See¬†[redirect URLs and wildcards](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth#redirect-urls-and-wildcards)¬†to add additional redirect URLs to your project.
- Magic links and OTPs share the same implementation. To send users a one-time code instead of a magic link,¬†[modify the magic link email template](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/templates)¬†to include¬†`{{ .Token }}`¬†instead of¬†`{{ .ConfirmationURL }}`.
- See our¬†[Twilio Phone Auth Guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/phone-login?showSmsProvider=Twilio)¬†for details about configuring WhatsApp sign in.

## Sign in a user through SSO

Attempts a single-sign on using an enterprise Identity Provider. A successful SSO attempt will redirect the current page to the identity provider authorization page. The redirect URL is implementation and SSO protocol specific.

- Before you can call this method you need to¬†[establish a connection](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/sso/auth-sso-saml#managing-saml-20-connections)¬†to an identity provider. Use the¬†[CLI commands](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/supabase-sso)¬†to do this.
- If you've associated an email domain to the identity provider, you can use the¬†`domain`¬†property to start a sign-in flow.
- In case you need to use a different way to start the authentication flow with an identity provider, you can use the¬†`providerId`¬†property. For example:
    - Mapping specific user email addresses with an identity provider.
    - Using different hints to identity the identity provider to be used by the user, like a company-specific page, IP address or other tracking information.

## Sign out a user

Inside a browser context, `signOut()` will remove the logged in user from the browser session and log them out - removing all items from localstorage and then trigger a `"SIGNED_OUT"` event.

- In order to use the¬†`signOut()`¬†method, the user needs to be signed in first.
- By default,¬†`signOut()`¬†uses the global scope, which signs out all other sessions that the user is logged into as well.
- Since Supabase Auth uses JWTs for authentication, the access token JWT will be valid until it's expired. When the user signs out, Supabase revokes the refresh token and deletes the JWT from the client-side. This does not revoke the JWT and it will still be valid until it expires.

### Parameters

- optionsRequiredSignOut
    
    Details
    

### Return Type

Promise<object>

## Send a password reset request

Sends a password reset request to an email address. This method supports the PKCE flow.

- The password reset flow consist of 2 broad steps: (i) Allow the user to login via the password reset link; (ii) Update the user's password.
- The¬†`resetPasswordForEmail()`¬†only sends a password reset link to the user's email. To update the user's password, see¬†[`updateUser()`](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-updateuser).
- A¬†`SIGNED_IN`¬†and¬†`PASSWORD_RECOVERY`¬†event will be emitted when the password recovery link is clicked. You can use¬†[`onAuthStateChange()`](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-onauthstatechange)¬†to listen and invoke a callback function on these events.
- When the user clicks the reset link in the email they are redirected back to your application. You can configure the URL that the user is redirected to with the¬†`redirectTo`¬†parameter. See¬†[redirect URLs and wildcards](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth#redirect-urls-and-wildcards)¬†to add additional redirect URLs to your project.
- After the user has been redirected successfully, prompt them for a new password and call¬†`updateUser()`:

`   1  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.updateUser({    2  password: new_password    3  })            `

### Parameters

- emailRequiredstring

## Verify and log in through OTP

Log in a user given a User supplied OTP or TokenHash received through mobile or email.

- The¬†`verifyOtp`¬†method takes in different verification types. If a phone number is used, the type can either be¬†`sms`¬†or¬†`phone_change`. If an email address is used, the type can be one of the following:¬†`email`,¬†`recovery`,¬†`invite`¬†or¬†`email_change`¬†(`signup`¬†and¬†`magiclink`¬†types are deprecated).
- The verification type used should be determined based on the corresponding auth method called before¬†`verifyOtp`¬†to sign up / sign-in a user.
- The¬†`TokenHash`¬†is contained in the¬†[email templates](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-email-templates)¬†and can be used to sign in. You may wish to use the hash with Magic Links for the PKCE flow for Server Side Auth. See¬†[this guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side/email-based-auth-with-pkce-flow-for-ssr)¬†for more details.

## Retrieve a session

Returns the session, refreshing it if necessary.

- This method retrieves the current local session (i.e local storage).
- The session contains a signed JWT and unencoded session data.
- Since the unencoded session data is retrieved from the local storage medium,¬†**do not**¬†rely on it as a source of trusted data on the server. It could be tampered with by the sender. If you need verified, trustworthy user data, call¬†[`getUser`](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-getuser)¬†instead.
- If the session has an expired access token, this method will use the refresh token to get a new session.

### Return Type

Promise<Union: expand to see options>

Details

Get the session data

`   1  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.getSession()            `

Response

---

## Retrieve a new session

Returns a new session, regardless of expiry status. Takes in an optional current session. If not passed in, then refreshSession() will attempt to retrieve it from getSession(). If the current session's refresh token is invalid, an error will be thrown.

- This method will refresh and return a new session whether the current one is expired or not.

### Parameters

- currentSessionOptionalobject
    
    The current session. If passed in, it must contain a refresh token.

Response

---

## Retrieve a user

Gets the current user details if there is an existing session. This method performs a network request to the Supabase Auth server, so the returned value is authentic and can be used to base authorization rules on.

- This method fetches the user object from the database instead of local session.
- This method is useful for checking if the user is authorized because it validates the user's access token JWT on the server.
- Should always be used when checking for user authorization on the server. On the client, you can instead use¬†`getSession().session.user`¬†for faster results.¬†`getSession`¬†is insecure on the server.

### Parameters

- jwtOptionalstring
    
    Takes in an optional access token JWT. If no JWT is provided, the JWT from the current session is used.
    

### Return Type

Promise<Union: expand to see options>

## Start auto-refresh session (non-browser)

Starts an auto-refresh process in the background. The session is checked every few seconds. Close to the time of expiration a process is started to refresh the session. If refreshing fails it will be retried for as long as necessary.

- Only useful in non-browser environments such as React Native or Electron.
- The Supabase Auth library automatically starts and stops proactively refreshing the session when a tab is focused or not.
- On non-browser platforms, such as mobile or desktop apps built with web technologies, the library is not able to effectively determine whether the application is¬†_focused_¬†or not.
- To give this hint to the application, you should be calling this method when the app is in focus and calling¬†`supabase.auth.stopAutoRefresh()`¬†when it's out of focus.

### Return Type

Promise<void>

Start and stop auto refresh in React Native

`   1  import { AppState } from 'react-native'    2      3  // make sure you register this only once!    4  AppState.addEventListener('change', (state) => {    5  if (state === 'active') {    6  supabase.auth.startAutoRefresh()    7  } else {    8  supabase.auth.stopAutoRefresh()    9  }    10  })            `

---

## Stop auto-refresh session (non-browser)

Stops an active auto refresh process running in the background (if any).

- Only useful in non-browser environments such as React Native or Electron.
- The Supabase Auth library automatically starts and stops proactively refreshing the session when a tab is focused or not.
- On non-browser platforms, such as mobile or desktop apps built with web technologies, the library is not able to effectively determine whether the application is¬†_focused_¬†or not.
- When your application goes in the background or out of focus, call this method to stop the proactive refreshing of the session.

### Return Type

Promise<void>

Start and stop auto refresh in React Native

`   1  import { AppState } from 'react-native'    2      3  // make sure you register this only once!    4  AppState.addEventListener('change', (state) => {    5  if (state === 'active') {    6  supabase.auth.startAutoRefresh()    7  } else {    8  supabase.auth.stopAutoRefresh()    9  }    10  })            `

## Auth MFA

This section contains methods commonly used for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and are invoked behind the `supabase.auth.mfa` namespace.

Currently, there is support for time-based one-time password (TOTP) and phone verification code as the 2nd factor. Recovery codes are not supported but users can enroll multiple factors, with an upper limit of 10.

Having a 2nd factor for recovery frees the user of the burden of having to store their recovery codes somewhere. It also reduces the attack surface since multiple recovery codes are usually generated compared to just having 1 backup factor.

---

## Enroll a factor

Starts the enrollment process for a new Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) factor. This method creates a new `unverified` factor. To verify a factor, present the QR code or secret to the user and ask them to add it to their authenticator app. The user has to enter the code from their authenticator app to verify it.

- Use¬†`totp`¬†or¬†`phone`¬†as the¬†`factorType`¬†and use the returned¬†`id`¬†to create a challenge.
- To create a challenge, see¬†[`mfa.challenge()`](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-mfa-challenge).
- To verify a challenge, see¬†[`mfa.verify()`](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-mfa-verify).
- To create and verify a TOTP challenge in a single step, see¬†[`mfa.challengeAndVerify()`](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-mfa-challengeandverify).
- To generate a QR code for the¬†`totp`¬†secret in Next.js, you can do the following:

`   1  <Image src={data.totp.qr_code} alt={data.totp.uri} layout="fill"></Image>            `

- The¬†`challenge`¬†and¬†`verify`¬†steps are separated when using Phone factors as the user will need time to receive and input the code obtained from the SMS in challenge.

## Delete a user

Delete a user. Requires a `service_role` key.

- The¬†`deleteUser()`¬†method requires the user's ID, which maps to the¬†`auth.users.id`¬†column.

### Parameters

- idRequiredstring
    
    The user id you want to remove.
    
- shouldSoftDeleteRequiredboolean
    
    If true, then the user will be soft-deleted (setting `deleted_at` to the current timestamp and disabling their account while preserving their data) from the auth schema. Defaults to false for backward compatibility.
    
    This function should only be called on a server. Never expose your `service_role` key in the browser.
    

### Return Type

## Send an email invite link

Sends an invite link to an email address.

- Sends an invite link to the user's email address.
- The¬†`inviteUserByEmail()`¬†method is typically used by administrators to invite users to join the application.
- Note that PKCE is not supported when using¬†`inviteUserByEmail`. This is because the browser initiating the invite is often different from the browser accepting the invite which makes it difficult to provide the security guarantees required of the PKCE flow.

### Parameters

- emailRequiredstring
    
    The email address of the user.
    
- optionsRequiredobject
    
    Additional options to be included when inviting.

## Invokes a Supabase Edge Function.

Invokes a function

Invoke a Supabase Edge Function.

- Requires an Authorization header.
- Invoke params generally match the¬†[Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)¬†spec.
- When you pass in a body to your function, we automatically attach the Content-Type header for¬†`Blob`,¬†`ArrayBuffer`,¬†`File`,¬†`FormData`¬†and¬†`String`. If it doesn't match any of these types we assume the payload is¬†`json`, serialize it and attach the¬†`Content-Type`¬†header as¬†`application/json`. You can override this behavior by passing in a¬†`Content-Type`¬†header of your own.
- Responses are automatically parsed as¬†`json`,¬†`blob`¬†and¬†`form-data`¬†depending on the¬†`Content-Type`¬†header sent by your function. Responses are parsed as¬†`text`¬†by default.

### Parameters

- functionNameRequiredstring
    
    The name of the Function to invoke.
    
- optionsRequiredFunctionInvokeOptions
    
    Options for invoking the Function.
    
    Details

## Subscribe to channel

Creates an event handler that listens to changes.

- By default, Broadcast and Presence are enabled for all projects.
- By default, listening to database changes is disabled for new projects due to database performance and security concerns. You can turn it on by managing Realtime's¬†[replication](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api#realtime-api-overview).
- You can receive the "previous" data for updates and deletes by setting the table's¬†`REPLICA IDENTITY`¬†to¬†`FULL`¬†(e.g.,¬†`ALTER TABLE your_table REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;`).
- Row level security is not applied to delete statements. When RLS is enabled and replica identity is set to full, only the primary key is sent to clients.

## Retrieve public URL

A simple convenience function to get the URL for an asset in a public bucket. If you do not want to use this function, you can construct the public URL by concatenating the bucket URL with the path to the asset. This function does not verify if the bucket is public. If a public URL is created for a bucket which is not public, you will not be able to download the asset.

- The bucket needs to be set to public, either via¬†[updateBucket()](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/storage-updatebucket)¬†or by going to Storage on¬†[supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard), clicking the overflow menu on a bucket and choosing "Make public"
- RLS policy permissions required:
    - `buckets`¬†table permissions: none
    - `objects`¬†table permissions: none
- Refer to the¬†[Storage guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/security/access-control)¬†on how access control works

### Parameters

- pathRequiredstring
    
    The path and name of the file to generate the public URL for. For example `folder/image.png`.
    
- optionsOptionalobject
    
    Details
    

### Return Type

object

## Release Notes

Supabase.js v2 release notes.

Install the latest version of @supabase/supabase-js

Terminal

`   1  npm install @supabase/supabase-js            `

### Explicit constructor options[#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/typescript-support#explicit-constructor-options)

All client specific options within the constructor are keyed to the library.

See [PR](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/pull/458):

`   1  const supabase = createClient(apiURL, apiKey, {    2  db: {    3  schema: 'public',    4  },    5  auth: {    6  storage: AsyncStorage,    7  autoRefreshToken: true,    8  persistSession: true,    9  detectSessionInUrl: true,    10  },    11  realtime: {    12  channels,    13  endpoint,    14  },    15  global: {    16  fetch: customFetch,    17  headers: DEFAULT_HEADERS,    18  },    19  })            `

### TypeScript support[#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/typescript-support#typescript-support)

The libraries now support typescript.

v1.0

``   1  // previously definitions were injected in the `from()` method    2  supabase.from<Definitions['Message']>('messages').select('\*')            ``

---

v2.0

``   1  import type { Database } from './DatabaseDefinitions'    2      3  // definitions are injected in `createClient()`    4  const supabase = createClient<Database>(SUPABASE_URL, ANON_KEY)    5      6  const { data } = await supabase.from('messages').select().match({ id: 1 })            ``

Types can be generated via the CLI:

Terminal

`   1  supabase start    2  supabase gen types typescript --local > DatabaseDefinitions.ts            `

### Data operations return minimal[#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/typescript-support#data-operations-return-minimal)

`.insert()` / `.upsert()` / `.update()` / `.delete()` don't return rows by default: [PR](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/pull/276).

Previously, these methods return inserted/updated/deleted rows by default (which caused [some confusion](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions/1548)), and you can opt to not return it by specifying `returning: 'minimal'`. Now the default behavior is to not return rows. To return inserted/updated/deleted rows, add a `.select()` call at the end, e.g.:

`   1  const { data, error } = await supabase    2  .from('my_table')    3  .delete()    4  .eq('id', 1)    5  .select()            `

### New ordering defaults[#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/typescript-support#new-ordering-defaults)

`.order()` now defaults to Postgres‚Äôs default: [PR](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/pull/283).

Previously `nullsFirst` defaults to `false` , meaning `null`s are ordered last. This is bad for performance if e.g. the column uses an index with `NULLS FIRST` (which is the default direction for indexes).

### Cookies and localstorage namespace[#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/typescript-support#cookies-and-localstorage-namespace)

Storage key name in the Auth library has changed to include project reference which means that existing websites that had their JWT expiry set to a longer time could find their users logged out with this upgrade.

``   1  const defaultStorageKey = `sb-${new URL(this.authUrl).hostname.split('.')[0]}-auth-token`            ``

### New Auth Types[#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/typescript-support#new-auth-types)

Typescript typings have been reworked. `Session` interface now guarantees that it will always have an `access_token`, `refresh_token` and `user`

./types.ts

`   1  interface Session {    2  provider_token?: string | null    3  access_token: string    4  expires_in?: number    5  expires_at?: number    6  refresh_token: string    7  token_type: string    8  user: User    9  }            `

### New Auth methods[#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/typescript-support#new-auth-methods)

We're removing the `signIn()` method in favor of more explicit function signatures: `signInWithPassword()`, `signInWithOtp()`, and `signInWithOAuth()`.

v1.0

`   1  const { data } = await supabase.auth.signIn({    2  email: 'hello@example',    3  password: 'pass',    4  })            `

---

v2.0

`   1  const { data } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({    2  email: 'hello@example',    3  password: 'pass',    4  })            `

### New Realtime methods[#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/typescript-support#new-realtime-methods)

There is a new `channel()` method in the Realtime library, which will be used for our Multiplayer updates.

We will deprecate the `.from().on().subscribe()` method previously used for listening to postgres changes.

`   1  supabase    2  .channel('any_string_you_want')    3  .on('presence', { event: 'track' }, (payload) => {    4  console.log(payload)    5  })    6  .subscribe()    7      8  supabase    9  .channel('any_string_you_want')    10  .on(    11  'postgres_changes',    12  {    13  event: 'INSERT',    14  schema: 'public',    15  table: 'movies',    16  },    17  (payload) => {    18  console.log(payload)    19  }    20  )    21  .subscribe()            `

### Deprecated setAuth()[#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/typescript-support#deprecated-setauth)

Deprecated and removed `setAuth()` . To set a custom `access_token` jwt instead, pass the custom header into the `createClient()` method provided: ([PR](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js/pull/340))

### All changes[#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/typescript-support#all-changes)

- `supabase-js`
    - `shouldThrowOnError`¬†has been removed until all the client libraries support this option ([PR](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/pull/490)).
- `postgrest-js`
    - TypeScript typings have been reworked¬†[PR](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/pull/279)
    - Use¬†`undefined`¬†instead of¬†`null`¬†for function params, types, etc. ([https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/pull/278](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/pull/278))
    - Some features are now obsolete: ([https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/pull/275](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/pull/275))
        - filter shorthands (e.g.¬†`cs`¬†vs.¬†`contains`)
        - `body`¬†in response (vs.¬†`data`)
        - `upsert`ing through the¬†`.insert()`¬†method
        - `auth`¬†method on¬†`PostgrestClient`
        - client-level¬†`throwOnError`
- `gotrue-js`
    - `supabase-js`¬†client allows passing a¬†`storageKey`¬†param which will allow the user to set the key used in local storage for storing the session. By default, this will be namespace-d with the supabase project ref. ([PR](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/pull/460))
    - `signIn`¬†method is now split into¬†`signInWithPassword`¬†,¬†`signInWithOtp`¬†,¬†`signInWithOAuth`¬†([PR](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js/pull/304))
    - Deprecated and removed¬†`session()`¬†,¬†`user()`¬†in favour of using¬†`getSession()`¬†instead.¬†`getSession()`¬†will always return a valid session if a user is already logged in, meaning no more random logouts. ([PR](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js/pull/299))
    - Deprecated and removed setting for¬†`multitab`¬†support because¬†`getSession()`¬†and gotrue‚Äôs reuse interval setting takes care of session management across multiple tabs ([PR](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js/pull/366))
    - No more throwing of random errors, gotrue-js v2 always returns a custom error type: ([PR](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js/pull/341))
        - `AuthSessionMissingError`
            - Indicates that a session is expected but missing
        - `AuthNoCookieError`
            - Indicates that a cookie is expected but missing
        - `AuthInvalidCredentialsError`
            - Indicates that the incorrect credentials were passed
    - Renamed the¬†`api`¬†namespace to¬†`admin`¬†, the¬†`admin`¬†namespace will only contain methods that should only be used in a trusted server-side environment with the service role key
    - Moved¬†`resetPasswordForEmail`¬†,¬†`getUser`¬†and¬†`updateUser`¬†to the¬†`GoTrueClient`¬†which means they will be accessible from the¬†`supabase.auth`¬†namespace in¬†`supabase-js`¬†instead of having to do¬†`supabase.auth.api`¬†to access them
    - Removed¬†`sendMobileOTP`¬†,¬†`sendMagicLinkEmail`¬†in favor of¬†`signInWithOtp`
    - Removed¬†`signInWithEmail`,¬†`signInWithPhone`¬†in favor of¬†`signInWithPassword`
    - Removed¬†`signUpWithEmail`¬†,¬†`signUpWithPhone`¬†in favor of¬†`signUp`
    - Replaced¬†`update`¬†with¬†`updateUser`
- `storage-js`
    - Return types are more strict. Functions types used to indicate that the data returned could be null even if there was no error. We now make use of union types which only mark the data as null if there is an error and vice versa. ([PR](https://github.com/supabase/storage-js/pull/60))
    - The¬†`upload`¬†and¬†`update`¬†function returns the path of the object uploaded as the¬†`path`¬†parameter. Previously the returned value had the bucket name prepended to the path which made it harder to pass the value on to other storage-js methods since all methods take the bucket name and path separately. We also chose to call the returned value¬†`path`¬†instead of¬†`Key`¬†([PR](https://github.com/supabase/storage-js/pull/75))
    - `getPublicURL`¬†only returns the public URL inside the data object. This keeps it consistent with our other methods of returning only within the data object. No error is returned since this method cannot does not throw an error ([PR](https://github.com/supabase/storage-js/pull/93))
    - signed urls are returned as¬†`signedUrl`¬†instead of¬†`signedURL`¬†in both¬†`createSignedUrl`¬†and¬†`createSignedUrls`¬†([PR](https://github.com/supabase/storage-js/pull/94))
    - Encodes URLs returned by¬†`createSignedUrl`,¬†`createSignedUrls`¬†and¬†`getPublicUrl`¬†([PR](https://github.com/supabase/storage-js/pull/86))
    - `createsignedUrl`¬†used to return a url directly and and within the data object. This was inconsistent. Now we always return values only inside the data object across all methods. ([PR](https://github.com/supabase/storage-js/pull/88))
    - `createBucket`¬†returns a data object instead of the name of the bucket directly. ([PR](https://github.com/supabase/storage-js/pull/89))
    - Fixed types for metadata ([PR](https://github.com/supabase/storage-js/pull/90))
    - Better error types make it easier to track down what went wrong quicker.
    - `SupabaseStorageClient`¬†is no longer exported. Use¬†`StorageClient`¬†instead. ([PR](https://github.com/supabase/storage-js/pull/92)).
- `realtime-js`
    - `RealtimeSubscription`¬†class no longer exists and replaced by¬†`RealtimeChannel`.
    - `RealtimeClient`'s¬†`disconnect`¬†method now returns type of¬†`void`¬†. It used to return type of¬†`Promise < { error: Error | null; data: boolean }`.
    - Removed¬†`removeAllSubscriptions`¬†and¬†`removeSubscription`¬†methods from¬†`SupabaseClient`¬†class.
    - Removed¬†`SupabaseRealtimeClient`¬†class.
    - Removed¬†`SupabaseQueryBuilder`¬†class.
    - Removed¬†`SupabaseEventTypes`¬†type.
        - Thinking about renaming this to something like¬†`RealtimePostgresChangeEvents`¬†and moving it to¬†`realtime-js`¬†v2.
    - Removed¬†`.from(‚Äôtable‚Äô).on(‚ÄôINSERT‚Äô, () ‚áí {}).subscribe()`¬†in favor of new Realtime client API.
- `functions-js`
    - supabase-js v1 only threw an error if the fetch call itself threw an error (network errors, etc) and not if the function returned HTTP errors like 400s or 500s. We have changed this behaviour to return an error if your function throws an error.
    - We have introduced new error types to distinguish between different kinds of errors. A¬†`FunctionsHttpError`¬†error is returned if your function throws an error,¬†`FunctionsRelayError`¬†if the Supabase Relay has an error processing your function and¬†`FunctionsFetchError`¬†if there is a network error in calling your function.
    - The correct content-type headers are automatically attached when sending the request if you don‚Äôt pass in a¬†`Content-Type`¬†header and pass in an argument to your function. We automatically attach the content type for¬†`Blob`,¬†`ArrayBuffer`,¬†`File`,¬†`FormData`¬†,`String`¬†. If it doesn‚Äôt match any of these we assume the payload is¬†`json`¬†, we serialise the payload as JSON and attach the content type as¬†`application/json`.
    - `responseType`¬†does not need to be explicitly passed in. We parse the response based on the¬†`Content-Type`¬†response header sent by the function. We support parsing the responses as¬†`text`,¬†`json`,¬†`blob`,¬†`form-data`¬†and are parsed as¬†`text`¬†by default.
