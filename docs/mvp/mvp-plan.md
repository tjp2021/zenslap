# AutoCRM MVP Implementation Plan

## Objective
Develop a robust, scalable MVP for AutoCRM by the end of tomorrow, focusing on core features that establish a solid foundation for future iterations and AI integration. Prioritize modularity, extensibility, and iterative growth.

## Core Focus Areas for MVP

### 1. Core Data Models

#### Ticket Schema
- Essential fields:
  - ticket_id
  - status
  - priority
  - creation_date
  - last_updated
- Flexible metadata: JSONB for dynamic fields and custom ticket attributes
- Conversation history: Placeholder for customer-agent interaction logs
- Scalability Placeholder: Add comments for future indexing and sharding
  ```sql
  -- TODO: Optimize indexing for high-frequency queries
  ```

#### User Schema
- Fields:
  - user_id
  - role
  - email
  - password_hash
- Basic roles: Customer, Agent, Admin
- Placeholder for multi-role and permission enhancements

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- Implement using Supabase's built-in authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC):
  - Basic roles (Customer, Agent, Admin)
- Scalability Placeholder: Add TODOs for extending roles and permissions

### 3. API Layer

#### Endpoints
- CRUD operations for tickets
- User management endpoints
- Documentation for all APIs

#### Real-Time Updates
- Use Supabase's real-time functionality
- Placeholder for scaling real-time updates
  ```typescript
  // TODO: Transition to pub-sub architecture
  ```

### 4. Queue Management Foundation

#### Features
- Basic ticket filtering (status, priority)
- Simple status updates
- Real-time integration for instant updates
- Scalability Placeholder: Add TODOs for load balancing and advanced filtering logic

## Strategic Adjustments from Feedback

### Scalability Concerns
- Focus on immediate functionality
- Add comments (TODOs) for future scalability enhancements
- Defer implementation of:
  - Pagination
  - Caching
  - Advanced indexing

### Vendor Lock-In
- Deprioritized for MVP stage

### Iterative Growth
- Design modular code
- Maintain clear boundaries between components

### Testing & Documentation
- Focus on critical path testing
- Document architectural decisions
- Minimize technical debt

## Immediate Action Items (Next 24 Hours)

### 1. Project Setup (2 Hours)
- Initialize repository with clear directory structure
- Set up Supabase project
  - Database configuration
  - Authentication setup
- Configure CI/CD pipeline

### 2. Core Implementation (6 Hours)

#### Database Schema
- Create ticket and user schemas with JSONB
- Implement basic indexing
  - Primary keys
  - Critical query paths

#### Authentication
- Basic authentication implementation
- Role-based access setup
- Testing:
  - User sign-up
  - Login
  - Role verification

#### API Development
- Build ticket CRUD endpoints
- Implement user management endpoints
- Enable real-time updates

### 3. Queue Management Foundation (4 Hours)
- Basic queue interface implementation
- Simple ticket status management
  - Open
  - In Progress
  - Closed
- Real-time update testing

### 4. Testing & Documentation (4 Hours)
- Unit tests for critical paths
- API documentation with examples
- Local development setup instructions

### 5. Deployment & Verification (2 Hours)
- AWS Amplify deployment
- Smoke testing
- Real-time functionality verification
- Authentication system verification

## Success Criteria for MVP

### Must Have
- Working authentication with RBAC
- Basic ticket CRUD operations
- Simple queue management with real-time updates
- Clear API documentation

### Should Have
- Basic queue management filters
- Role-based permissions
- Core functionality unit tests

### Nice to Have
- Webhook support
- Advanced filtering
- Bulk operations

## Scalability and AI Integration Placeholders

### Database Optimizations
```sql
-- TODO: Implement indexing strategy
-- TODO: Plan for partitioning
```

### Architecture Evolution
```typescript
// TODO: Implement pub-sub architecture for real-time updates
// TODO: Add AI workflow metadata fields
//   - suggested_responses
//   - customer_sentiment
```

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on core functionality first
- Document decisions and TODOs
- Maintain clean, modular code
- Prepare for AI integration
- Build with scalability in mind
