## Parallel Apply Tool Documentation

### Overview
The `parallel_apply` tool is a powerful utility for implementing similar changes across multiple files or regions of code simultaneously. It's particularly useful for systematic refactoring, pattern implementation, or standardizing code across a codebase.

### Command Structure
```typescript
parallel_apply({
  edit_plan: string,    // Detailed description of the changes
  edit_regions: Array<{
    relative_workspace_path: string,  // File path
    start_line: number,              // Starting line (1-indexed)
    end_line: number                 // Ending line (1-indexed)
  }>
})
```

### Use Cases
1. **Pattern Implementation**
   - Adding error handling to multiple service methods
   - Implementing logging across different modules
   - Standardizing type definitions across files

2. **Systematic Refactoring**
   - Converting class components to functional components
   - Updating import paths after restructuring
   - Standardizing error handling patterns

3. **Code Standardization**
   - Adding consistent documentation
   - Implementing consistent method signatures
   - Standardizing type usage

### Best Practices
1. **Clear Edit Plans**
   - Be specific about the changes
   - Include context and reasoning
   - Define expected outcomes

2. **Appropriate Region Selection**
   - Include sufficient context in each region
   - Avoid overlapping regions
   - Keep regions focused and minimal

3. **Validation**
   - Review changes before applying
   - Ensure consistency across edits
   - Verify type safety is maintained

### Example Usage
```typescript
// Adding standardized error handling
parallel_apply({
  edit_plan: "Implement standardized error handling using ErrorBoundary pattern",
  edit_regions: [
    {
      relative_workspace_path: "src/services/userService.ts",
      start_line: 10,
      end_line: 50
    },
    {
      relative_workspace_path: "src/services/ticketService.ts",
      start_line: 15,
      end_line: 60
    }
  ]
})

// Standardizing type imports
parallel_apply({
  edit_plan: "Update type imports to use centralized type system",
  edit_regions: [
    {
      relative_workspace_path: "src/components/UserList.tsx",
      start_line: 1,
      end_line: 10
    },
    {
      relative_workspace_path: "src/components/TicketList.tsx",
      start_line: 1,
      end_line: 12
    }
  ]
})
```

### Limitations

# API Layer Anti-Pattern Analysis

## 1. Root Problem Identified
```
Frontend → /api/routes → Next.js → Supabase → Database
```
We discovered an unnecessary layer of indirection with Next.js API routes when Supabase already provides:
- Direct client access
- Built-in auth
- Type safety
- RLS policies

## 2. Anti-Patterns Fixed
- Double-wrapping Supabase calls
- Unnecessary API middleware
- Extra network hops
- Duplicate auth handling
- Redundant service layer

## 3. Contributing Factors
- Creating services that mimicked Supabase functionality
- Adding complexity with no benefit
- Writing boilerplate code for auth that Supabase handles
- Making simple operations go through multiple layers

## 4. Time Investment Analysis
- Debugging auth issues that Supabase handles
- Creating/maintaining unnecessary API routes
- Writing duplicate type definitions
- Managing state across multiple layers

## 5. Core Lesson
We over-engineered a solution when the infrastructure (Supabase) already provided everything we needed. This is a classic case of "not using the platform" and creating unnecessary abstraction.

## Next.js 14 Route Params Analysis

### Problem/Feature Overview
- Initial Requirements: Access route parameters (params.id) in a ticket details page
- Key Challenges: Next.js 14 makes route parameters async by default
- Success Criteria: No infinite loops, proper data loading

### Solution Attempts
#### Attempt #1: Component Optimization
- Approach: Added memoization to Activities component
- Implementation: Used React.memo and useCallback
- Outcome: Failed - didn't address root cause
- Learnings: Performance optimizations don't fix architectural issues

#### Attempt #2: Hook Refactoring
- Approach: Fixed useTicketActivities hook
- Implementation: Added pre-defined fetch functions
- Outcome: Failed - still accessing Promise directly
- Learnings: Hook implementation wasn't the core issue

#### Attempt #3: Auth Synchronization
- Approach: Added auth checks to hooks
- Implementation: Gated data fetching behind auth state
- Outcome: Failed - didn't solve Promise access
- Learnings: Auth wasn't related to the core problem

### Final Solution
#### Implementation Details
```typescript
// Server Component (page.tsx)
export default function Page({ params }) {
  return <ClientComponent id={params.id} />
}

// Client Component (separate file)
'use client'
export function ClientComponent({ id }) {
  const { data } = useData(id)
}
```

#### Why It Works
- Server components can safely access async route parameters
- Client components receive unwrapped values
- Maintains proper Next.js 14 data flow

#### Key Components
1. Server-side parameter unwrapping
2. Clean server/client boundary
3. Proper prop passing

### Key Lessons
#### Technical Insights
- Route parameters in Next.js 14 are async by default
- Server components are needed for parameter access
- Client/server component split is crucial

#### Process Improvements
- Read error messages carefully
- Focus on architectural issues first
- Understand framework constraints

#### Best Practices
- Split components based on data access needs
- Keep server/client boundary clean
- Pass unwrapped values as props

#### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Accessing route params directly in client components
- Fixing symptoms instead of causes
- Ignoring framework architecture

## Next.js 14 Dynamic Route Parameters Debug Analysis

### Problem Analysis
- Initial Error: `params.id` needed to be awaited before use
- Error Location: Next.js 14 dynamic route parameter handling
- Error Type: Runtime error in server component

### Solution Attempts

#### Attempt #1: Direct Access
```typescript
export default function TicketDetailsPage({ params }: PageProps) {
  return <TicketDetailsClient id={params.id} />
}
```
- Approach: Direct access to params.id
- Failure: Didn't handle async nature of params
- Learning: Next.js 14 route params are async

#### Attempt #2: Await Property
```typescript
export default async function TicketDetailsPage({ params }: PageProps) {
  const id = await params.id
  return <TicketDetailsClient id={id} />
}
```
- Approach: Awaiting individual property
- Failure: Can't await properties directly
- Learning: Need to await entire params object

#### Attempt #3: Promise Resolution
```typescript
export default async function TicketDetailsPage({ params }: PageProps) {
  const id = await Promise.resolve(params.id)
  return <TicketDetailsClient id={id} />
}
```
- Approach: Using Promise.resolve
- Failure: Wrong approach to handling async params
- Learning: Promise.resolve doesn't solve the underlying issue

#### Final Working Solution
```typescript
interface PageProps {
  params: Promise<{ id: string }>
}

export default async function TicketDetailsPage({ params }: PageProps) {
  const resolvedParams = await params
  return <TicketDetailsClient id={resolvedParams.id} />
}
```
- Approach: Proper typing and awaiting of params
- Success: Correctly handles async nature of params
- Key Insight: Params is a Promise of an object, not an object with Promise properties

### Key Learnings
1. **Type System Importance**
   - Correct typing (`Promise<{ id: string }>`) was crucial
   - TypeScript helps enforce correct async handling

2. **Next.js 14 Changes**
   - Dynamic route parameters are now async by default
   - Must await entire params object, not individual properties

3. **Debugging Process**
   - Started with simplest solution
   - Each failure provided more insight
   - Error messages pointed to correct solution

4. **Best Practices**
   - Always check framework version specifics
   - Pay attention to type definitions
   - Follow error message links for documentation

### Anti-Patterns Identified
1. Trying to await individual properties
2. Using Promise.resolve as a workaround
3. Ignoring TypeScript's role in catching async issues

This case study shows the importance of:
1. Understanding framework changes
2. Reading error messages carefully
3. Using proper TypeScript types
4. Iterative debugging with learning from each attempt

## React Context Provider Mounting Loop Analysis

### Problem Analysis
- Initial Symptom: Repeated "TicketsProvider mounted" logs
- Root Cause: Dependency chain causing infinite re-renders
- Error Pattern: Component → useEffect → loadData → state update → re-render → repeat

### Solution Attempts

#### Attempt #1: Basic Memoization
```typescript
const defaultClient = useMemo(() => createClientComponentClient<Database>(), [])
const supabase = supabaseClient || defaultClient
```
- Approach: Memoize Supabase client creation
- Failure Point: Intermediate variable still caused rerenders
- Learning: Partial memoization can still lead to dependency chains

#### Attempt #2: Direct Client Usage
```typescript
const supabase = supabaseClient || createClientComponentClient<Database>()
```
- Approach: Remove memoization, use direct client
- Failure Point: New client on every render
- Learning: Stateful clients need stable references

#### Attempt #3: Single useMemo
```typescript
const supabase = useMemo(() => 
  supabaseClient || createClientComponentClient<Database>(),
  [supabaseClient]
)
```
- Approach: Single, complete memoization
- Success: Stable client reference
- Learning: Minimize dependency chain points

### Dependency Chain Analysis
Before:
```
render → new defaultClient → new supabase → new loadTickets → useEffect trigger → render
```

After:
```
render → stable supabase → stable loadTickets → useEffect (only on user.id change)
```

### Key Optimizations
1. **Supabase Client Stability**
   - Single useMemo for client creation
   - Only depends on passed client prop
   - Eliminates unnecessary client recreation

2. **Callback Optimization**
   - Changed from `[user]` to `[user?.id]` dependency
   - Prevents rerenders on non-id user changes
   - More precise dependency tracking

3. **Effect Cleanup**
   - Removed console.log noise
   - Cleaner dependency array
   - More predictable execution

### Best Practices Identified
1. **Dependency Management**
   - Use primitive values in deps arrays
   - Minimize dependency chain length
   - Break circular dependencies

2. **Memoization Strategy**
   - Single point of memoization
   - Clear dependency boundaries
   - Stable reference creation

3. **State Updates**
   - Batch related state updates
   - Use functional updates
   - Minimize cascading updates

### Anti-Patterns Avoided
1. **Dependency Chain**
   - Multiple levels of derived values
   - Circular update patterns
   - Unnecessary state updates

2. **Memoization**
   - Partial/incomplete memoization
   - Over-memoization
   - Wrong dependency arrays

3. **Effect Handling**
   - Too broad effect scope
   - Unnecessary effect triggers
   - Missing cleanup

### Core Lessons
1. React's rendering mental model is crucial
2. Dependency chains need careful management
3. Memoization is about stability, not just performance
4. Effects should have clear, minimal dependencies

This case study demonstrates how seemingly simple React patterns can create complex dependency chains, and how methodical debugging and optimization can resolve them.

## Authentication Flow Analysis

### Problem/Feature Overview
- Initial Requirements: Implement proper authentication flow with redirects
- Key Challenges: Redirect not happening after successful sign-in
- Success Criteria: Seamless sign-in to callback to tickets flow

### Solution Attempts
#### Attempt #1: Middleware-based Solution
- Approach: Added middleware handling for callback route
- Implementation: Added logging and explicit handling
- Outcome: Failed - never reached callback URL
- Learnings: Problem was earlier in the flow

#### Attempt #2: Callback Route Enhancement
- Approach: Added session verification and logging
- Implementation: Enhanced error handling in callback
- Outcome: Failed - route was fine but unreachable
- Learnings: Callback implementation wasn't the issue

#### Attempt #3: Login Page Session Check
- Approach: Added session checks on login page
- Implementation: useEffect for session verification
- Outcome: Failed - only helped with existing sessions
- Learnings: Initial sign-in flow needed attention

### Final Solution
#### Implementation Details
```typescript
const { data: { subscription } } = supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((event, session) => {
  console.log('🔄 AuthUI - Auth State Change:', {
    event,
    hasSession: !!session,
    userId: session?.user?.id,
    email: session?.user?.email,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  })

  if (event === 'SIGNED_IN' && session) {
    console.log('↪️ AuthUI - Handling SIGNED_IN, redirecting to callback')
    window.location.href = `${window.location.origin}/auth/callback`
  }
})
```

#### Why It Works
1. Explicit handling of SIGNED_IN event
2. Direct control over redirect timing
3. Hard redirect using window.location.href
4. Proper flow through callback route

#### Key Components
1. Event listener for auth state changes
2. Immediate redirect after sign-in
3. Comprehensive logging
4. Proper session exchange in callback

### Key Lessons
#### Technical Insights
- Don't trust built-in redirect mechanisms blindly
- Take control of critical flow points
- Use hard redirects when needed
- Watch auth state changes explicitly

#### Process Improvements
- Add comprehensive logging
- Track state changes
- Follow the entire flow
- Test each step independently

#### Best Practices
- Explicit over implicit
- Control critical transitions
- Log extensively during debugging
- Handle auth events directly

#### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Relying solely on built-in redirects
- Missing auth state changes
- Insufficient logging
- Multiple redirect mechanisms

### Complete Flow
1. User enters credentials and clicks sign in
2. Supabase auth succeeds
3. SIGNED_IN event fires
4. Event handler catches immediately
5. Forces redirect to /auth/callback
6. Callback route exchanges code for session
7. Sets up proper auth state
8. Redirects to /tickets

## React Form State Management Case Study

### Problem/Feature Overview
- Initial Requirements: Edit ticket details with proper state management
- Key Challenges: Form state resetting unexpectedly, multiple re-renders
- Success Criteria: Stable edit mode, proper state transitions

### Solution Attempts

#### Attempt #1: Multiple useState Approach
- Approach: Separate state variables for editing, validation, and form data
- Implementation: Multiple useState hooks
- Outcome: Failed - state synchronization issues
- Learnings: Too many sources of truth

#### Attempt #2: useEffect Debug
- Approach: Added debug logging and effect cleanup
- Implementation: Console logs for state transitions
- Outcome: Failed - identified circular dependencies
- Learnings: Effects were causing cascading updates

#### Attempt #3: Form Component Memoization
- Approach: Memoized form component and handlers
- Implementation: useMemo and useCallback
- Outcome: Partial success - reduced re-renders but didn't fix state
- Learnings: Memoization alone doesn't solve state management

### Final Solution
#### Implementation Details
```typescript
// Form state reducer pattern
type FormAction = 
  | { type: 'START_EDITING' }
  | { type: 'CANCEL_EDITING' }
  | { type: 'START_SUBMITTING' }
  | { type: 'SET_VALIDATION_ERRORS', errors: Record<string, string> }
  | { type: 'MARK_FIELD_DIRTY', field: keyof UpdateTicketDTO }
  | { type: 'RESET' }

function formReducer(state: FormState, action: FormAction): FormState {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'START_EDITING':
      return {
        ...state,
        status: 'editing',
        validationErrors: {},
        dirtyFields: new Set<keyof UpdateTicketDTO>()
      }
    // ... other cases
  }
}

// Usage with proper memoization
const EditForm = useMemo(() => {
  return (
    <form 
      key={isEditing ? 'editing' : 'viewing'} 
      onSubmit={handleSubmit}
    >
      {/* Form fields */}
    </form>
  )
}, [/* dependencies */])
```

#### Why It Works
1. Single source of truth (reducer)
2. Clear state transitions
3. Proper form key for remounting
4. Memoized render prevention
5. Type-safe state management

### Key Lessons

- Schema cache validation failures in Supabase

**Success Criteria**
- Activities visible in UI
- Proper access control (staff vs regular users)
- Referential integrity maintained
- Valid schema cache for Supabase operations

### Solution Attempts

#### Attempt #1: Add RLS Policies
- Approach: Created RLS policies for ticket_activities table
- Implementation: Added view/insert/delete policies with proper role checks
```sql
CREATE POLICY view_ticket_activities ON ticket_activities
    FOR SELECT TO authenticated
    USING (EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM tickets t ...));
```
- Outcome: Failed - Foreign key relationship error
- Learnings: RLS alone wasn't sufficient, needed proper table relationships

#### Attempt #2: Fix Foreign Key Relationship
- Approach: Added explicit foreign key constraint
- Implementation: 
```sql
ALTER TABLE ticket_activities
ADD CONSTRAINT ticket_activities_ticket_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (ticket_id) 
REFERENCES tickets(id)
ON DELETE CASCADE;
```
- Outcome: Success - Fixed schema cache and RLS issues
- Learnings: Explicit schema relationships are crucial for Supabase's security model

### Final Solution
**Implementation Details**
1. RLS Policies:
   - View policy for access control
   - Insert policy for content creation
   - Delete policy for content management

2. Schema Relationships:
   - Explicit foreign key constraints
   - ON DELETE CASCADE for referential integrity
   - Proper schema cache validation

**Why It Works**
- Supabase's schema cache can validate table relationships
- RLS policies can safely reference related tables
- API layer has complete schema information
- Referential integrity is guaranteed

**Key Components**
1. Table Relationships:
   ```sql
   ticket_activities.ticket_id -> tickets.id
   ```
2. Security Layers:
   - Database constraints
   - Schema cache validation
   - RLS policies
   - API access control

### Key Lessons

**Technical Insights**
1. Supabase Schema Cache:

   - Ignoring schema cache

2. Security:
   - Testing only with admin rights
   - Assuming relationships
   - Skipping API tests
   - Ignoring cache validation

# PostgREST Relationship Hell - Analysis & Learnings

## Problem/Feature Overview

### Initial Requirements
- Set up proper PostgREST relationships between `ticket_activities`, `tickets`, and `users_secure` tables
- Enable proper querying of related data through both SQL and PostgREST API
- Maintain consistent schema definitions across all layers

### Key Challenges
1. Multiple Abstraction Layers:
   - Raw PostgreSQL schema
   - PostgREST API conventions
   - TypeScript type definitions
   - Supabase client queries
   - Direct SQL queries

2. Inconsistent Naming Conventions:
   - Confusion between `name` vs `title` columns
   - Foreign key constraint naming patterns
   - Relationship path definitions

3. Documentation Gaps:
   - PostgREST relationship syntax differences between API and SQL
   - Foreign key constraint naming requirements
   - Schema validation requirements

### Success Criteria
- Working SQL queries for relationship data
- Correct TypeScript schema definitions
- Consistent naming across all layers
- Clear understanding of PostgREST relationship patterns

## Solution Attempts

### Attempt #1
- Approach: Using explicit foreign key constraint names in PostgREST syntax
- Implementation: `ticket:tickets!ta_ticket_id_fkey`
- Outcome: Failed
- Learnings: PostgREST SQL syntax differs from API syntax

### Attempt #2
- Approach: Using arrow syntax for relationships
- Implementation: `ticket->tickets`
- Outcome: Failed
- Learnings: Arrow syntax is not valid in this context

### Attempt #3
- Approach: Using standard SQL JOIN syntax
- Implementation: `left join tickets t on t.id = ta.ticket_id`
- Outcome: Success
- Learnings: Start with basic SQL to verify relationships before PostgREST abstraction

### Attempt #4
- Approach: Checking actual database schema
- Implementation: Querying `information_schema.columns`
- Outcome: Success
- Learnings: Always verify actual column names instead of assuming

## Final Solution

### Implementation Details
1. Correct SQL Query:
```sql
select 
  ta.id,
  ta.activity_type,
  ta.content,
  ta.created_at,
  t.id as ticket_id,
  t.title,
  t.description,
  t.status,
  t.priority,
  t.created_by,
  t.assignee
from ticket_activities ta
left join tickets t on t.id = ta.ticket_id
```

2. Correct Schema Definition:
```typescript
TICKET: {
  path: 'tickets',
  fields: {
    id: 'id',
    title: 'title',
    description: 'description',
    status: 'status',
    priority: 'priority',
    created_by: 'created_by',
    assignee: 'assignee'
  }
}
```

### Why It Works
- Uses verified column names from actual database
- Follows standard SQL syntax for direct queries
- Simplifies relationship paths for PostgREST
- Matches actual database structure

### Key Components

## Recommendations for Future

### Immediate Actions
1. Implement schema validation in CI/CD:
   ```typescript
   // Example schema validation check
   function validateSchema() {
     const dbSchema = fetchDatabaseSchema()
     const typeSchema = loadTypeScriptSchema()
     assertSchemaMatch(dbSchema, typeSchema)
   }
   ```

2. Create type generation pipeline:
   ```bash
   # Example workflow
   supabase gen types typescript --project-id "your-project-id" > types/supabase.ts
   ```

3. Document PostgREST patterns:
   ```typescript
   // Example pattern documentation
   const POSTGREST_PATTERNS = {
     directJoin: 'table(*)',
     foreignKey: 'table!constraint(*)',
     embedded: 'table{relation{fields}}',
   }
   ```

## Conclusion
The core issue stemmed from not having a single source of truth and trying to work across multiple abstraction layers without proper validation. Moving forward, we should:

1. Trust but verify:
   - Always check actual database schema
   - Validate relationships work at each layer
   - Test assumptions before proceeding

2. Build better tooling:
   - Automated schema validation
   - Type generation pipeline
   - Relationship testing suite

3. Improve processes:
   - Start with basic SQL
   - Verify each layer independently
   - Document patterns and gotchas

By following these learnings and implementing the recommended improvements, we can avoid similar issues in the future and build a more robust development process.

# Migration Hell - Analysis & Learnings

## Problem/Feature Overview

### Initial Requirements
- Create `ai_analyses` table in Supabase
- Set up proper permissions, RLS, and functions
- Ensure table exists in production

### Key Challenges & Failures
1. **Migration Verification Failures**:
   - Migration appeared successful but table wasn't created
   - Silent failures masked real issues
   - Error messages were misleading

2. **Procedural SQL Mistakes**:
   ```sql
   -- WRONG: Can't use IF/THEN outside PL/pgSQL
   IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_tables...) THEN
   -- WRONG: Can't use EXCEPTION outside PL/pgSQL
   EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
   ```

3. **Order of Operations Issues**:
   ```sql
   -- WRONG: Trying to drop policies before table exists
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "..." ON ai_analyses;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ai_analyses;
   ```

## Solution Attempts

### Attempt #1: Full Migration with Error Handling
- Approach: Complex DO block with error handling
- Failed Because: Syntax errors in procedural SQL
- Learning: Don't mix DDL and procedural SQL in migrations

### Attempt #2: Migration with Verification
- Approach: Added IF EXISTS checks
- Failed Because: IF/THEN outside PL/pgSQL
- Learning: Migrations are DDL scripts, not procedures

### Attempt #3: Basic Table Creation
- Approach: Stripped down to basic CREATE TABLE
- Succeeded Because: 
  - Pure DDL statements
  - Correct order of operations
  - No procedural SQL

## Key Lessons

1. **Migration Best Practices**:
   - Start with minimal DDL statements
   - Test each component separately
   - Use `CASCADE` with `DROP TYPE` to handle dependencies

2. **Verification Strategy**:
   - Don't trust migration success messages
   - Verify table existence separately
   - Check actual database state

3. **SQL Statement Order**:
   ```sql
   -- CORRECT ORDER:
   DROP TYPE IF EXISTS ... CASCADE;  -- Handles dependencies
   CREATE TYPE ...;
   CREATE TABLE ...;
   CREATE INDEX ...;
   GRANT permissions ...;
   ```

## Anti-Patterns Identified

1. **Overcomplicating Migrations**:
   ```sql
   -- ANTI-PATTERN: Complex error handling
   DO $$ 
   BEGIN
     -- Complex logic
   EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
     -- Error handling
   END $$;
   ```

2. **Trusting Migration Output**:
   ```bash
   # ANTI-PATTERN: Assuming success
   Applying migration ... [success]
   # CORRECT: Verify actual state
   SELECT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_tables...);
   ```

3. **Mixed SQL Paradigms**:
   ```sql
   -- ANTI-PATTERN: Mixing DDL and procedural
   CREATE TABLE ...;
   IF NOT EXISTS ... THEN
   ```

## Recommendations

1. **Migration Template**:
   ```sql
   -- 1. Drop dependencies with CASCADE
   DROP TYPE IF EXISTS ... CASCADE;
   
   -- 2. Create types
   CREATE TYPE ... AS ENUM (...);
   
   -- 3. Create base table
   CREATE TABLE ... (
     -- columns
   );
   
   -- 4. Add constraints
   ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT ...;
   
   -- 5. Create indexes
   CREATE INDEX ...;
   
   -- 6. Set permissions
   GRANT ... TO ...;
   
   -- 7. Enable RLS and policies
   ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   CREATE POLICY ...;
   ```

2. **Verification Process**:
   - Use separate verification scripts
   - Check actual database state
   - Don't trust migration output

3. **Development Flow**:
   - Start with minimal table structure
   - Add features incrementally
   - Verify each step separately

## Going Forward

1. Create a migration checklist:
   - [ ] Drop dependencies with CASCADE
   - [ ] Create types before tables
   - [ ] Add constraints after table creation
   - [ ] Verify actual database state

2. Use separate verification scripts:
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name, table_schema 
   FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public';
   ```

3. Break complex migrations into smaller steps:
   - Base table structure
   - Indexes and constraints
   - Permissions and policies
   - Functions and triggers
