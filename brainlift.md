# Type System Implementation Analysis

## 1. Problem/Feature Overview
- Implementation of a static type system for enhanced code safety
- Need for compile-time type checking
- Goals: Prevent runtime type errors while maintaining flexibility

## 2. Solution Attempts
### First Attempt
- Basic type inference system
- Limited to primitive types
- Challenges with generic types and polymorphism

### Second Attempt
- Introduction of type variables
- Implementation of unification algorithm
- Issues with recursive types

## 3. Final Solution
- Hindley-Milner type inference system
- Support for:
  - Generic types
  - Type constraints
  - Polymorphic functions
- Integration with existing compiler pipeline

## 4. Key Lessons
- Importance of gradual typing
- Balance between type safety and developer experience
- Performance considerations in type checking
- Value of type system documentation

## Parallel Apply Tool Documentation

### Overview
The `parallel_apply` tool is a powerful utility for implementing similar changes across multiple files or regions of code simultaneously. It's particularly useful for systematic refactoring, pattern implementation, or standardizing code across a codebase.

### Command Structure
```typescript
parallel_apply({
  edit_plan: string,    // Detailed description of the changes
  edit_regions: Array<{
    relative_workspace_path: string,  // File path
    start_line: number,              // Starting line (1-indexed)
    end_line: number                 // Ending line (1-indexed)
  }>
})
```

### Use Cases
1. **Pattern Implementation**
   - Adding error handling to multiple service methods
   - Implementing logging across different modules
   - Standardizing type definitions across files

2. **Systematic Refactoring**
   - Converting class components to functional components
   - Updating import paths after restructuring
   - Standardizing error handling patterns

3. **Code Standardization**
   - Adding consistent documentation
   - Implementing consistent method signatures
   - Standardizing type usage

### Best Practices
1. **Clear Edit Plans**
   - Be specific about the changes
   - Include context and reasoning
   - Define expected outcomes

2. **Appropriate Region Selection**
   - Include sufficient context in each region
   - Avoid overlapping regions
   - Keep regions focused and minimal

3. **Validation**
   - Review changes before applying
   - Ensure consistency across edits
   - Verify type safety is maintained

### Example Usage
```typescript
// Adding standardized error handling
parallel_apply({
  edit_plan: "Implement standardized error handling using ErrorBoundary pattern",
  edit_regions: [
    {
      relative_workspace_path: "src/services/userService.ts",
      start_line: 10,
      end_line: 50
    },
    {
      relative_workspace_path: "src/services/ticketService.ts",
      start_line: 15,
      end_line: 60
    }
  ]
})

// Standardizing type imports
parallel_apply({
  edit_plan: "Update type imports to use centralized type system",
  edit_regions: [
    {
      relative_workspace_path: "src/components/UserList.tsx",
      start_line: 1,
      end_line: 10
    },
    {
      relative_workspace_path: "src/components/TicketList.tsx",
      start_line: 1,
      end_line: 12
    }
  ]
})
```

### Limitations
1. Maximum of 50 files per operation
2. Regions must be non-overlapping
3. Changes should be similar in nature
4. Complex refactoring may require multiple passes

### Integration with Other Tools
- Works alongside other code modification tools
- Can be combined with type checking
- Supports various file types and languages
