# Testing Insights: Ticket Service Debugging

## Problem Context
Debugging failing tests in a Next.js/TypeScript ticket management service with Supabase integration. The tests were failing due to mock configuration issues and inconsistent error handling.

## Key Learnings

### Jest Mock Configuration
1. **Mock Hoisting**
   - Jest hoists mock declarations before module imports
   - Mock setup must be placed before imports
   - Order of mock declarations affects test behavior

2. **TypeScript Integration**
   ```typescript
   interface MockMethods {
     insert: jest.Mock
     select: jest.Mock
     // ... other methods
   }
   ```
   - Define clear interfaces for mocks
   - Improves type safety and IDE support
   - Makes mock behavior more predictable

3. **Method Chaining**
   ```typescript
   const mockMethods = {
     insert: jest.fn(() => mockMethods),
     select: jest.fn(() => mockMethods)
   }
   ```
   - Return mock object for chainable methods
   - Keep consistent reference to mock object
   - Simulate actual client behavior

### Validation Layers
1. **Schema Validation**
   - Happens first using Zod
   - Validates types and formats
   - Returns standardized error messages

2. **Database Validation**
   - Secondary layer after schema
   - Handles database-specific constraints
   - Different error message format

3. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - Match error to correct validation layer
   - Don't mix validation concerns
   - Test each layer independently

### Best Practices
1. **Mock Setup**
   - Place mocks before imports
   - Use TypeScript interfaces
   - Keep mock implementation simple

2. **Test Structure**
   - Test at the appropriate layer
   - Match actual service behavior
   - Clear separation of concerns

3. **Error Handling**
   - Consistent error messages
   - Proper error propagation
   - Match validation layer

### Anti-Patterns
1. **Configuration**
   - Mixing mock order
   - Missing type definitions
   - Inconsistent mock behavior

2. **Testing**
   - Wrong validation layer
   - Complex mock chains
   - Implementation details

3. **Error Handling**
   - Mixed error messages
   - Wrong error source
   - Inconsistent formats

## Impact
- Reduced test flakiness
- Improved error handling
- Better type safety
- More maintainable tests

# Database Initialization Debugging

## Problem Context
Debugging ticket creation failures in the Next.js/TypeScript CRM application with Supabase integration. The issue manifested as a 400 Bad Request error when attempting to create tickets, despite correct form data submission.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Initial Symptoms
1. **API Response**
   ```typescript
   POST /api/tickets 400 (Bad Request)
   Error: Failed to create ticket
   ```
   - Form data correctly structured
   - API endpoint properly configured
   - Environment variables set correctly

2. **Connection Issues**
   ```
   Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist.
   ```
   - Indicated potential database connectivity problems
   - Supabase client properly initialized
   - Environment variables correctly set

### Investigation Path
1. **Client Setup**
   - Consolidated duplicate Supabase client initializations

   - Verified environment variables

2. **Database Schema**
   - Discovered missing migration files
   - No table structure defined
   - Seed file causing errors

3. **Solution Implementation**
   ```sql
   create table if not exists tickets (
       id uuid default uuid_generate_v4() primary key,
       title text not null,
       description text not null,
       status text not null default 'open',
       priority text not null default 'medium',
       metadata jsonb not null default '{}'::jsonb,
       created_at timestamptz not null default now(),
       updated_at timestamptz not null default now()
   );
   ```
   - Created proper migration file
   - Added appropriate constraints
   - Implemented necessary indexes

## Key Learnings
