## Implementation Notes

### Week 1 Focus
- Implement ALL Absolute Necessity items
- Core functionality must include:
  - Real-time pattern detection
  - Clear reasoning transparency
  - Actionable insights
  - Success tracking

### Success Metrics
**Must Track:**
- Pattern detection accuracy
- Citation accuracy
- Intervention success rates
- User feedback metrics
- System response time

### Tech Stack (Minimal)
- Supabase with pgvector
- OpenAI API
- Next.js/React
- Existing AIService class

## APPENDIX: Implementation Requirements (2024-03-20)

### Critical Data Quality Controls
- MUST implement minimum content validation
- MUST handle error logs appropriately
- MUST detect and flag vague content
- MUST maintain clean embeddings

### System Reliability Measures
- MUST validate all embeddings
- MUST monitor embedding failures
- MUST track system health metrics
- MUST implement basic error recovery

### Performance Safeguards
- MUST manage context window limits
- MUST implement content summarization
- MUST maintain response time targets
- MUST handle concurrent requests

### Enhanced Quality Metrics
- MUST track detailed feedback categories
- MUST monitor pattern accuracy
- MUST validate insight relevance
- MUST measure actionability

## APPENDIX: Implementation Decisions (2024-03-20)

### Data Flow Decisions
- ‚úÖ Index tickets on both creation AND updates
- ‚úÖ Include comments and internal notes with tickets
- ‚úÖ Bulk import for historical data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need embedding failure strategy:
  - Implement retry logic
  - Log failures
  - Fall back to keyword matching
  - Alert on high failure rates

### Infrastructure Decisions
- ‚úÖ Run Chroma as part of main app initially
  - Simpler deployment/maintenance
  - Easier debugging
  - Can split later if needed
- ‚úÖ ChromaService to be part of AIService
  - Tight coupling with AI operations
  - Shared context and resources
  - Unified monitoring

### Open Questions (Need Decisions)
- üìä Resource Requirements
  - Expected ticket volume unknown
  - Storage budget undefined
  - Scaling thresholds undefined

- üß™ Testing Baselines
  - Need synthetic test data strategy
  - Baseline accuracy undefined
  - Improvement metrics undefined

### Real-time Strategy
- ‚úÖ Have both webhook and real-time capabilities
- ‚úÖ Using Supabase real-time for notifications
- ‚úÖ WebhookService available for external integrations

### Feedback Implementation
- MVP Approach:
  1. Store all feedback
  2. Manual pattern analysis
  3. Adjust based on data
  - Defer automatic adjustments for post-MVP
