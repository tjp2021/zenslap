# Context Transition: Ticket Service Testing

## Context Summary
- Working on ticket service testing in AutoCRM project
- Successfully resolved mock configuration and error handling issues
- Improved test reliability and maintainability

## Key Problems
- Mock configuration ordering with Jest
- TypeScript integration with mocks
- Inconsistent error handling between validation layers
- Method chaining in Supabase client mocks

## Solution Progress
- Fixed mock hoisting issues
- Implemented proper TypeScript interfaces
- Standardized error messages
- Improved mock method chaining

## Learning Points
- Jest mock declaration ordering is critical
- TypeScript interfaces improve mock reliability
- Validation layers need consistent error handling
- Method chaining requires careful mock implementation

## Next Steps
- Document testing patterns in codebase
- Review error handling consistency
- Consider adding test utilities for common patterns
- Plan for future test maintenance
